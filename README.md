 Breast Cancer Detection App
Let me introduce you to XGBoost, the most popular Machine Learning library in the ML community. It has been the major driving factor behind the algorithms that have won big ML contests in recent years. Its speed and performance are unrivaled, and it routinely surpasses all other supervised learning algorithms.

The basic technique may execute on clusters of GPUs or even over a network of computers because the library is parallelizable. This enables high-performance ML tasks to be solved by training on hundreds of millions of training instances.
